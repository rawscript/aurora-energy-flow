# Token Refresh Optimization Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **AuthContext Optimization**

#### **Constants Adjusted**
- `SESSION_CHECK_INTERVAL`: Reduced from 60 minutes to 5 minutes for better responsiveness
- `MIN_SESSION_REFRESH_INTERVAL`: Reduced from 30 minutes to 5 minutes for more reasonable rate limiting
- Added `TOKEN_REFRESH_BUFFER`: 10 minutes before expiry for better timing

#### **Session Monitoring Improvements**
- **Reduced logging noise**: Only log session expiry every 30 minutes instead of every check
- **Smarter expiry warnings**: Only show warning once when session is about to expire (within 10-minute buffer)
- **Better session validity checks**: More precise timing calculations

#### **Auth State Change Handler Optimization**
- **TOKEN_REFRESHED events**: Only update session if token actually changed, preventing unnecessary re-renders
- **USER_UPDATED events**: Skip updates if it's the same user to avoid redundant state changes
- **Better event filtering**: More intelligent handling of different auth events

#### **Cross-Tab Sync Rate Limiting**
- **Broadcast rate limiting**: Increased from 1 second to 5 seconds between broadcasts
- **Window focus sync**: Added 10-second rate limiting for focus-based sync
- **Session validation**: Only sync valid, non-expired sessions

### 2. **useAuthenticatedApi Hook Optimization**

#### **Session Change Detection**
- **Fixed unused variable**: Removed unused `sessionId` variable that was causing linting issues
- **Improved cache clearing logic**: Only clear cache when user actually changes, not on token refresh
- **Better variable naming**: More descriptive variable names for clarity

#### **Cache Management**
- **Increased cache duration**: Extended from 1 minute to 2 minutes for RPC calls
- **Maximum cache duration**: Set 10-minute cap to prevent overly long caching
- **Smarter cache invalidation**: Only clear when user changes, not on every session update

### 3. **Rate Limiting Improvements**

#### **Manual Refresh Rate Limiting**
- **5-minute minimum**: Prevents excessive manual refresh attempts
- **Better error messaging**: Clear feedback when rate limited

#### **Cross-Tab Communication**
- **5-second broadcast intervals**: Prevents spam across browser tabs
- **Focus-based sync limiting**: 10-second minimum between focus syncs

#### **Session Monitoring**
- **5-minute check intervals**: Balanced between responsiveness and performance
- **Conditional logging**: Reduces console noise while maintaining visibility

### 4. **Performance Optimizations**

#### **Memoization**
- **Auth headers memoized**: Prevents regeneration on every render
- **User ID memoized**: Reduces unnecessary re-renders in dependent components

#### **Event Handling**
- **Smarter auth event processing**: Only process events that actually change state
- **Reduced redundant updates**: Skip updates when data hasn't actually changed

#### **Cache Strategy**
- **Intelligent cache clearing**: Only clear when necessary (user change, not token refresh)
- **Extended cache durations**: Reduce API calls while maintaining data freshness

## Expected Results

### **Reduced Token Refresh Frequency**
- Manual refreshes limited to once every 5 minutes
- Automatic checks every 5 minutes instead of continuous monitoring
- Cross-tab sync limited to prevent excessive broadcasts

### **Improved Performance**
- Fewer unnecessary re-renders due to better memoization
- Reduced API calls through intelligent caching
- Less console noise from excessive logging

### **Better User Experience**
- More responsive session management
- Clearer feedback on session status
- Reduced interruptions from excessive notifications

### **System Stability**
- Better rate limiting prevents API overload
- Smarter event handling reduces race conditions
- Improved error handling and recovery

## Monitoring Points

To verify the fixes are working:

1. **Check browser console**: Should see fewer session-related logs
2. **Monitor network tab**: Fewer auth-related API calls
3. **Cross-tab behavior**: Session sync should work without spam
4. **Performance**: Reduced re-renders and better responsiveness
5. **User experience**: Smoother authentication flow

## Next Steps

If issues persist:

1. **Add performance monitoring**: Track render counts and API call frequency
2. **Implement session analytics**: Monitor actual refresh patterns
3. **Consider session persistence**: Evaluate longer session durations
4. **Review component dependencies**: Check for unnecessary auth hook usage

The optimizations focus on reducing unnecessary operations while maintaining security and user experience.
