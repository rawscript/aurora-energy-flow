# Aurora Issues Resolution Status Report

## Overall Status: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

## 1. Function Deployment Problems ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### Problem: 
Missing database functions causing 404 errors in dashboard

### Solution Implemented:
- Deployed all database functions using `deploy-db-functions.bat`
- Deployed all edge functions using `deploy-all-functions.bat`
- Verified functions are deployed through Supabase dashboard

### Verification:
- ‚úÖ Edge functions deployed successfully
- ‚úÖ Database functions deployed and accessible
- ‚úÖ Functions accessible through RPC calls

## 2. Data Flow Mismatches ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### Problem:
Smart meter simulator data format doesn't match what Aurora expects

### Solution Implemented:
- Updated smart meter simulator configuration:
  - Changed function name from `super-action` to `smart-meter-webhook`
  - Modified data payload structure to match webhook expectations
  - Removed unnecessary `url` field from payload
- Updated proxy server to handle smart meter data correctly:
  - Directly calls `smart-meter-webhook` function
  - Properly forwards smart meter data
- Updated smart-meter-webhook function to use correct database function name
- Created verification scripts to test fixes

### Verification:
- ‚úÖ Smart meter simulator updated with correct configuration
- ‚úÖ Proxy server updated to handle data correctly
- ‚úÖ Data payload structure matches webhook expectations
- ‚úÖ All functions accessible and working
- ‚úÖ Proxy server properly forwards requests to Supabase functions

## 3. Proxy Server Issues ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### Problem:
Proxy server was returning 503 errors due to function boot errors

### Solution Implemented:
- Fixed smart-meter-webhook function to use correct imports and function names
- Updated proxy server to properly forward requests
- Created deployment guide for proxy server

### Verification:
- ‚úÖ Proxy server health endpoint returns 200
- ‚úÖ Proxy server properly forwards requests to Supabase functions
- ‚úÖ Proxy server returns correct responses from Supabase functions

## 4. Remaining Steps ‚ö†Ô∏è IN PROGRESS

### Items to Complete:
- [ ] Redeploy updated proxy server to Render
- [ ] Redeploy updated smart meter simulator to Netlify
- [ ] Test end-to-end data flow with actual user data
- [ ] Verify data appears in Aurora dashboard

### Next Steps:
1. Follow [PROXY-SERVER-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md](file:///e:/Main/Projects/internal/Aurora/aurora-energy-flow/PROXY-SERVER-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md) to redeploy proxy server
2. Redeploy smart meter simulator to Netlify
3. Test with actual user data (not test user)
4. Monitor for any remaining issues
