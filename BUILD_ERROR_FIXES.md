# Aurora Energy Flow: Build Error Fixes

## Problem Identified

The build error was caused by trying to use Puppeteer (a Node.js library) in the frontend code. Vite was attempting to bundle Puppeteer for the browser, but it contains Node.js-specific modules like `node:url` and `proxy-agent` that are not available in the browser environment.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Removed Puppeteer Dependencies from Frontend

**File**: `package.json`
- Removed `puppeteer` and `puppeteer-core` from frontend dependencies
- These libraries are now only used in the backend Supabase functions

### 2. Moved Puppeteer Logic to Backend

**File**: `src/utils/kplcPuppeteer.ts`
- Removed direct Puppeteer usage in frontend
- Modified the service to call the backend Puppeteer function via Supabase functions
- Kept only the data handling and storage logic in the frontend

### 3. Updated Frontend Hooks

**File**: `src/hooks/useKPLCPuppeteer.ts`
- Modified to call the backend Puppeteer service via Supabase functions
- Removed duplicate calls to Puppeteer service
- Fixed syntax errors

**File**: `src/hooks/useKPLCTokens.ts`
- Updated `purchaseTokens` function to call backend Puppeteer service
- Updated `checkKPLCBalance` function to call backend Puppeteer service

### 4. Kept Backend Puppeteer Implementation

**File**: `supabase/functions/puppeteer_kplc_service/index.ts`
- This function continues to use Puppeteer properly in the backend environment
- Uses Deno's Puppeteer module which is appropriate for Supabase functions

## How It Works Now

1. **Frontend** makes requests to Supabase functions
2. **Supabase functions** run Puppeteer in the backend environment
3. **Puppeteer** scrapes KPLC portal and returns data
4. **Backend** sends data back to frontend
5. **Frontend** displays data to user

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **No Build Errors**: Frontend no longer tries to bundle Node.js modules
2. **Proper Separation**: Browser code separated from server code
3. **Better Performance**: Puppeteer runs server-side, not on user's device
4. **Security**: User credentials handled server-side
5. **Scalability**: Backend can handle multiple requests efficiently

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Run `npm install` to update dependencies
2. Run `npm run build` to test the build
3. Run `npm run dev` to test functionality

The build should now complete successfully without the `node:url` and `proxy-agent` errors.
