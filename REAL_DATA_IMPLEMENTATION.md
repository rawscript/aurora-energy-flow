# Real Smart Meter Data Implementation

This document outlines the changes made to implement real data from smart meters in the Aurora Energy Flow application.

## Overview

The application has been updated to use real data from smart meters when available, while still providing simulated data as a fallback when no meter is set up. This ensures that users can get accurate insights based on their actual energy usage patterns.

## Key Changes

### 1. Enhanced `useRealTimeEnergy` Hook

- Added functionality to detect whether a user has a meter set up
- Implemented real data fetching from the Supabase database
- Created a mechanism to record real readings in the database
- Added real-time subscription to energy readings updates
- Improved analytics calculations based on real data patterns
- Maintained mock data generation as a fallback

### 2. Updated UI Components

- Added indicators to show whether real or simulated data is being used
- Enhanced the SmartMeterStatus component to show connection status
- Added a button to easily set up a real meter
- Updated the MeterSetup component to emphasize the benefits of real data
- Created a new RealTimeInsights component to provide personalized insights

### 3. Database Integration

- Utilized existing Supabase functions for data retrieval and insertion
- Implemented proper error handling for database operations
- Added real-time subscriptions to database changes

## How It Works

1. **Meter Detection**:
   - When a user logs in, the application checks if they have a meter set up in their profile
   - If a meter is found, the app switches to real data mode
   - If no meter is found, the app uses simulated data

2. **Real Data Collection**:
   - Real readings are stored in the `energy_readings` table
   - The `insert_energy_reading` function is used to record new readings
   - The `get_latest_energy_data` function retrieves aggregated data

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Charts and statistics are updated to reflect real data when available
   - UI indicators show whether real or simulated data is being used
   - Insights are generated based on actual usage patterns

4. **User Experience**:
   - Clear indicators show when simulated data is being used
   - Easy path to set up a real meter
   - Seamless transition between simulated and real data

## Benefits

- **Accurate Insights**: Users get personalized insights based on their actual energy usage
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live data from smart meters provides up-to-date information
- **Better Decision Making**: Accurate data leads to better energy management decisions
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Recommendations are tailored to actual usage patterns

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with more smart meter types and providers
- Advanced anomaly detection based on real usage patterns
- Machine learning models trained on real data for better predictions
- More detailed device-level breakdown using smart plugs and IoT devices
