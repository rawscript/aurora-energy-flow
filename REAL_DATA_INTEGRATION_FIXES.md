# Aurora Energy Flow: Real Data Integration Fixes

## Problem Identified

The "Live Smart Meter Data" button was generating dummy data instead of fetching from the real integration. When there was no connection to a smart meter or inverter, it should show a message prompting the user to connect to the appropriate device based on their energy provider.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Updated useRealTimeEnergy Hook

**File**: `src/hooks/useRealTimeEnergy.ts`

Modified the `getNewReading` function to:
- Check for real data from the database instead of generating dummy data
- Show appropriate messages when no recent data is available
- Provide specific guidance based on energy provider (smart meter vs solar inverter)

### 2. Updated EnergyDashboard Component

**File**: `src/components/EnergyDashboard.tsx`

Enhanced the UI to:
- Show "No recent data" badge when connected but no data is available
- Show loading spinner during data fetching
- Display appropriate messages for different energy provider types

### 3. Improved Meter Context

**File**: `src/contexts/MeterContext.tsx`

Ensured proper connection status management:
- Correctly identifies device type based on energy provider
- Provides accurate connection status to components
- Handles connection/disconnection properly

### 4. Enhanced RealTimeInsights Component

**File**: `src/components/RealTimeInsights.tsx`

Improved insight generation:
- Shows appropriate messages when no meter is connected
- Provides energy provider-specific guidance
- Handles error states gracefully

## How It Works Now

1. **Connected State**: When a meter/inverter is connected:
   - Button fetches real data from the database
   - Shows loading state during fetch
   - Displays actual readings if available
   - Shows "No recent data" message if no data is available

2. **Disconnected State**: When no meter/inverter is connected:
   - Shows banner prompting user to connect
   - Provides energy provider-specific setup guidance
   - Disables the "Get Reading" button

3. **Data Flow**:
   - Smart meters send data via webhook to the database
   - Solar inverters send data via webhook to the database
   - Frontend fetches latest data from database when user clicks "Get Reading"
   - UI updates based on actual data or appropriate messages

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Real Data Integration**: Uses actual meter/inverter data instead of dummy data
2. **User Guidance**: Provides clear instructions for connecting devices
3. **Provider-Specific**: Tailors messages based on energy provider type
4. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles various error states
5. **Performance**: Reduces unnecessary data generation on the frontend

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Test with a connected smart meter:
   - Click "Get Reading" button
   - Should fetch real data from database
   - Should show actual readings or "No recent data" message

2. Test without a connected device:
   - Should show connection banner
   - "Get Reading" button should be disabled
   - Should provide setup guidance

3. Test with different energy providers:
   - KPLC should show smart meter guidance
   - Solar providers should show inverter guidance
