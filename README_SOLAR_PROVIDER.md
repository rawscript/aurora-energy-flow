# Solar Provider Integration

This document explains how the solar provider integration works in the Aurora Energy Flow application.

## Overview

The solar provider integration allows users to track payments, view transaction history, and make payments for their solar systems. The implementation currently supports M-KOPA Solar and other generic solar providers with simulated data.

## Components

### 1. useSolarProvider Hook

The `useSolarProvider` hook is the core of the solar provider integration. It provides:

- Payment status information (total paid, remaining balance, ownership percentage)
- Transaction history
- Payment processing functionality
- Loading and error states

#### Key Functions

- `fetchPaymentStatus()` - Retrieves the current payment status
- `fetchTransactions()` - Retrieves transaction history
- `purchaseCredits(amount, paymentMethod, phoneNumber)` - Processes a payment

### 2. SolarDashboard Component

The `SolarDashboard` component provides a comprehensive UI for solar provider users:

- Ownership progress visualization
- Payment status cards
- Payment history chart
- Transaction list
- Payment processing dialog
- System information

### 3. TestSolarProvider Page

The `TestSolarProvider` page allows developers to test the solar provider integration without needing to navigate through the full application.

## How It Works

1. **Data Fetching**: When a user selects a solar provider, the application loads payment status and transaction data
2. **UI Display**: The SolarDashboard component displays this information in an organized, user-friendly interface
3. **Payment Processing**: Users can make payments through various methods (M-PESA, Airtel Money, Bank Transfer)
4. **Real-time Updates**: After a payment, the UI updates to reflect the new payment status

## Future Improvements

To integrate with real solar provider APIs:

1. Replace the simulated data in `useSolarProvider` with actual API calls
2. Implement proper authentication with solar provider services
3. Add webhook support for real-time payment notifications
4. Implement proper error handling for network issues
5. Add caching strategies for better performance

## Testing

To test the solar provider integration:

1. Navigate to `/test-solar` in the application
2. View the simulated payment status and transactions
3. Try making a payment using the test interface

## Supported Providers

Currently supported solar providers:

- M-KOPA Solar
- Generic Solar Provider (for other solar companies)

## API Integration Points

For real API integration, the following endpoints would need to be implemented:

1. **Payment Status Endpoint**: Retrieve current payment status
2. **Transactions Endpoint**: Retrieve transaction history
3. **Payment Processing Endpoint**: Process new payments
4. **Webhook Endpoint**: Receive real-time payment notifications

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:

- Network error detection
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms
- Loading states during API calls

## Security Considerations

When implementing real API integration:

1. Never expose API keys in client-side code
2. Use secure authentication mechanisms
3. Validate all user input
4. Implement proper rate limiting
5. Use HTTPS for all API communications
